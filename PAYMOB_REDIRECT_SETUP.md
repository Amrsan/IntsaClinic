# PayMob Redirect Setup - Fix Payment Redirections

## The Problem
Your PayMob payments are redirecting to default pages instead of your custom-built success/failure pages that integrate with your site design.

## The Solution
I've updated your payment flow to properly integrate with your site. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. Updated Files
- ✅ `success.html` - Now includes your site's header/footer and proper styling
- ✅ `failure.html` - Now includes your site's header/footer and proper styling  
- ✅ `paymob-callback.html` - Better user experience with status updates
- ✅ `config.js` - Unified callback URL configuration

### 2. PayMob Dashboard Configuration (CRITICAL STEP)
You MUST update your PayMob dashboard with these EXACT URLs:

**Login to PayMob Dashboard → Developers → Payment Integrations → Edit Integration**

Set ALL three callback URLs to the same value:
```
Success URL: https://yourdomain.com/paymob-callback.html
Failure URL: https://yourdomain.com/paymob-callback.html  
Pending URL: https://yourdomain.com/paymob-callback.html
```

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

### 3. How the New Flow Works

1. **Payment Processing**: User completes payment on PayMob
2. **Callback Handler**: PayMob redirects to `paymob-callback.html` 
3. **Processing**: Callback handler processes the result and updates your database
4. **Smart Redirect**: Based on payment result, redirects to:
   - `success.html` (for successful payments)
   - `failure.html` (for failed payments)
5. **Integrated Experience**: Both pages now include your site's header/footer and proper navigation back to your main site

### 4. Key Improvements

**Success Page (`success.html`)**:
- ✅ Includes your site header and footer
- ✅ Shows transaction details
- ✅ Professional design matching your site
- ✅ "Back to Home" and "About Our Services" buttons
- ✅ Clear next steps for customers

**Failure Page (`failure.html`)**:
- ✅ Includes your site header and footer  
- ✅ Shows error details and transaction ID
- ✅ Helpful troubleshooting steps
- ✅ "Try Again", "Modify Booking", and "Back to Home" buttons
- ✅ Professional error handling

**Callback Handler (`paymob-callback.html`)**:
- ✅ Better loading experience with status updates
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Smooth transitions to final pages

### 5. Testing Instructions

1. **Update PayMob Dashboard** with the callback URLs above
2. **Test a payment** using PayMob test cards:
   - Success: `4987654321098769`
   - Failure: `4000000000000002`
3. **Verify the flow**:
   - Payment should redirect to callback handler
   - You should see processing messages
   - Then redirect to success/failure page with your site design
   - Header and footer should be visible
   - Navigation should work properly

### 6. Troubleshooting

**If still redirecting to wrong pages:**
- Check PayMob dashboard URLs are exactly as specified above
- Clear browser cache
- Verify your domain is correct in the URLs
- Check browser console for any errors

**If pages look broken:**
- Ensure `header.html` and `footer.html` files exist
- Check browser console for loading errors
- Verify all file paths are correct

**If database not updating:**
- Check Supabase configuration in `config.js`
- Verify database permissions
- Check browser console for errors

### 7. Next Steps

1. Update PayMob dashboard URLs ⚠️ CRITICAL
2. Test the payment flow
3. Customize success/failure page content if needed
4. Update contact information in failure page

The payment flow will now provide a seamless experience that matches your site's design and properly redirects users back to your built pages instead of generic ones.
